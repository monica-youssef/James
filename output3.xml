<document><section><run bold="true">Overview: In his letter to the churches, James identifies himself as a servant of Christ sent to the Jews of the Diaspora. In the early church it was customary to assume that New Testament books had been written by apostles or under the close supervision of an apostle, and two of the original twelve were called James. One of these was the brother of John and son of Zebedee, and the other was the son of Alphaeus. The first of these was the associate of Peter and John and became the first head of the church at Jerusalem, where he was martyred about a.d. 44. The second disappeared from view after the resurrection of Jesus. Some of the Fathers assumed that one of these two wrote this letter, though they were not sure which one. Most Fathers, though, concluded that it was another James, the one who appears in the New Testament among the brothers of Jesus. This James was head of the Jerusalem church from a.d. 44 to 62 and is a much more plausible candidate for authorship than either of the others. The assumption then was that this James, whose authority derived from his close kinship with Jesus, was writing from the Jewish capital to those Jews who had left Palestine and were scattered across the Roman world. The fact that he refers to himself as a “servant” was regarded as a sign of his humility and as standing in sharp contrast to the usual letter-writing practice of the time. Today the authenticity of James is still questioned, but most scholars recognize that it must be one of the earliest New Testament writings. The authorship of James the brother of Jesus continues to find its defenders and must be regarded as plausible, even if it cannot be proved now any more than it could be in patristic times. To be a slave of Christ is, for the apostles, greater than having command of all the kingdoms of the world (Didymus, Oecumenius). This is a voluntary servanthood (Hilary of Arles). James wrote this letter to those suffering persecution (Bede).</run></section><section><run bold="true">1:1</run></section><section><run bold="true">The Identity of James</run></section><section><run bold="true">The Martyrdom of James. Josephus: Caesar sent Albinus to Judea as procurator when he was informed of the death of Festus. But the younger Annas, who as I said had received the high priesthood, was headstrong in character and audacious in the extreme. He belonged to the sect of the Sadducees, who in judging offenders are cruel beyond any of the Jews, as I have already made clear. Being a man of this kind, Annas thought that he had a convenient opportunity, as Festus was dead and Albinus still on the way. So he assembled a council of judges and brought it before James, the brother of Jesus, known as Christ, and several others. Annas charged them with breaking the law and handed them over to be stoned. But those who were considered the most fair-minded people in the city, and strict in their observance of the law, were most indignant at this, and sent secretly to the king, imploring him to write to Annas to stop behaving in this way. His conduct had been wrong from the first. Some of them too waylaid Albinus on the road from Alexandria and explained that it was illegal for Annas to assemble a council without his authority. Convinced by their arguments, Albinus wrote an angry letter to Annas, threatening to punish him. In consequence, King Agrippa deprived him of the high priesthood, which he had held for three months only, and appointed Jeshua son of Dammaeus.

Hilary of Arles: Christ deigned to reveal himself to James after his passion, and eventually it became proverbial to say: “He appeared also to James.”3 James refers to himself as a servant, but we must remember that there are two kinds of servitude, voluntary and involuntary. The involuntary servant is a slave who fears punishment, and therefore his service does not spring from love. But the voluntary servant is really no different from a son.

Bede: We read that when Stephen was martyred a great persecution of the church broke out at Jerusalem and that they were all scattered across the countryside of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles. James then wrote this letter to those who had been scattered because they had suffered persecution for the sake of righteousness. And not only to them, but also, as the rest of the letter testifies, to those who had become Christians but who were still struggling to achieve perfection, as well as to those who remained outside the faith themselves and did their best to persecute and disturb believers. All of these people were exiles, though for different reasons. But we also read in the Acts of the Apostles that at the time of our Lord’s death there were devout Jews “from every nation under heaven.”5 What these nations were is explained a little further on, where Luke mentions Parthians, Medes, Elamites, inhabitants of Mesopotamia, and so on.6 James also exhorts the righteous not to lose their faith, and he rebukes sinners, warning them that they must refrain from sinning and practice virtue, so that they would not be condemned by those who had received the sacraments of faith in an unfruitful way, even worthy of hell. He goes now to warn unbelievers to repent of the murder of the Savior and of the other crimes in which they were implicated before divine retribution overtook them secretly, or even openly for that matter.

Isho’dad of Merv: The opening resembles the titles of St. Paul’s letters, and perhaps James is the author of it, whoever he may be. He was unacquainted with Paul’s custom of writing to one particular nation and city, and for a particular reason. Instead, this author writes to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations because of the captivity, and not to the churches in every place, because he had no particular reason to be so specific. Commentaries, Prologue.91:2–15 TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS</run></section><section><run bold="true">Overview: James was writing to people who were suffering from temptations of various kinds, though there is no sign that a general persecution of Christians had as yet broken out. The Greek word peirasmos can be translated either as “trial” or as “temptation,” and the second of these possibilities dominated the Fathers’ interpretation of these verses. To them the cure for temptation was patient endurance, which was the fruit of a spiritual wisdom that could be obtained only from God. There was no problem with obtaining this, as long as believers asked God for wisdom in faith, without doubting that they would receive it. Doubt and riches appear as the greatest enemies of true faith because in their different ways, they both contributed to human pride and arrogance. Once those vices took control, it was impossible to wage war against temptation, because temptation was also the fruit of human lusts and therefore a close ally of pride. It was essential therefore to overcome this basic human weakness, since failure to do so would lead inevitably to spiritual death.Prepare for many temptations (Chryosostom, Hilary of Arles). They will be like a raging torrent that only a strong swimmer can negotiate (Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine). The joy of faith is proved through endurance (Oecumenius, Symeon). No one can take away this joy (Bede). We are tempted by adversities in order to learn the virtue of patience (Bede) and faith (Hilary of Arles). We are not to be discouraged by these trials (Andreas). The purity of faith is made perfect by patient endurance of affliction (Bede, Andreas, Oecumenius), which casts out fear (Hilary of Arles).We pray that the faith that justifies may increase in those who already have it and also that it may be given to those who have not yet received it (Augustine). We must ask God for the spiritual wisdom to face temptations (Bede, Oecumenius, Theophylact), a wisdom that only God can give (Augustine, Hilary of Arles, Bede). One who does not ask in faith is not heard (Hilary of Arles, Bede). The root of doubt is pride (Cyril of Alexandria), which easily turns into despair (Oecumenius). Ask without hesitation without being double-minded (Bede, Oecumenius). Do not worry inordinately about your guilt, but count on God’s mercy (Hermas). A double-minded person is one who prays to God yet fails to obtain anything because one’s conscience is still accusing all the time (Bede). Such a person is unstable (Origen), like waves on the sea (Oecumenius). Meanwhile every good thing comes to the humble (Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius, Theophylact).Only those who endure adversity are rewarded (Bede). What puffs up the rich is what brings them down (Oecumenius). Their wealth is vulnerable (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Oecumenius). The heavier the endured sufferings of the righteous, the more courageous are their victories (Sulpicius Severus). A crown awaits them (Chrysostom, Bede). James encourages the hope that the present situation will be put aright (Didymus). Any testing that comes from God is for good, not for evil. Not so with the devil, who tempts in order to kill and who does not know us as God knows (Cyril of Jerusalem, Augustine, Bede, Andreas). God may abandon us at times to reveal our own stubborn willing (Peter Chrysologus). To find a remedy our very nature must be healed (Augustine). Lust does not give birth unless it conceives, and it does not conceive unless it receives willing consent to commit evil (Augustine). Until we labor and give birth to our corrupt thoughts, we seem happy and joyful, but once the wicked child called sin is born we are in pain as we realize the shame to which we ourselves have given birth (Chrysostom). Lust coaxes and urges on, positively encouraging us to do something bad. If we ponder it willingly, then it will conceive and give birth (Augustine, Hesychius). Suggestion, experiment and consent are the three stages of temptation (Bede, Hilary).</run></section><section><run bold="true">1:2</run></section><section><run bold="true">Finding Joy in Suffering</run></section><section><run bold="true">Count It Joy.

Cyril of Jerusalem: “Falling into temptation” may mean being overwhelmed by temptation, for temptation is like a raging torrent which engulfs the traveler.

But if others who lack their strength try to do it, they are overcome. Mystagogical Lectures 5.17.2</run></section><section><run bold="true">Prepare for Temptation.

Listen to the one who says: “If you want to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for temptation.”3 And again Christ said: “In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage.”4 And again: “straight and narrow is the way.”5 Everywhere you see suffering being praised, everywhere it is accepted as necessary for us. For in the world there is no one who wins a trophy without suffering, who has not strengthened himself with labors and dieting and exercise and vigils and many other things like that.

Therefore I beg you right from the start not to welcome any corrupt thought, for if we do so the seeds will grow inside us, and if we get to that stage, the sin inside us will come out in deeds and strike us dead by condemning us, in spite of all our confessions and tears. For there is nothing more destructive than sin. Catena.68</run></section><section><run bold="true">Lust Requires Consent. Augustine: Each one of us is tempted by our own lust, so let us fight and resist and not give in nor allow ourselves to be lured by it, nor allow it to conceive anything to which it might then give birth. It is like this—lust coaxes and coddles you, it excites and urges you on, positively encouraging you to do something wrong. Do not give in and it will not conceive. If you ponder it willingly and with pleasure, then it will conceive and give birth, and you will die. Sermons 77a.3.69</run></section><section><run bold="true">Three Stages of Temptation. Bede: There are three stages in temptation. The first is suggestion, the second is experiment, and the third is consent. If we resist the devil’s suggestions, then we have victory over temptation and deserve to inherit the crown of life. But if we let the enemy’s suggestions gradually take control of us, then we find that we are taken away from the right path and start to indulge in sin. However, if we go no further than initial experiments, we may have offended God, but we have not yet fallen into mortal sin. However, if we continue down the path of depravity and start to embrace evildoing by giving our full consent to it, then we are deserving of death, and the enemy has triumphed over us.

Catena.711:16–27 THE WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</run></section><section><run bold="true">Overview: Above all else, believers in Christ must be careful not to fall into the trap of deception in spiritual matters. Every spiritual gift comes from God and reflects his character as the Father of lights. Every good endowment is an undeserved, a free gift of God for which we pray every day (Augustine). What God gives is without defect (Didymus). The soul is progressively enlightened in its ascent after the resurrection (Origen), cleansed from wickedness (Oecumenius). The procession of Light spreads itself generously toward us in a unitive way (Pseudo-Dionysius). Nothing can add or subtract from God’s glory (Novatian), who is unchanging in his divine essence (Severus). No shadow can cut off God’s light (Gregory the Great). Anyone who stands in this light wishes to share it with others (Symeon). We must, however, distinguish our begottenness as children of light from the eternal begottenness of the Son (Andreas, Bede, Oecumenius).Therefore, those who possess God’s Spirit will be self-controlled in their behavior and will avoid every form of wickedness. Above all, truly spiritual persons will do their utmost to put their faith into practice, since that is the ultimate test of what it means to be born again in Christ. The truth heard is less prone to corruption than the truth spoken (Augustine). The tongue must be disciplined (Bede). To be quick to hear implies eagerness to put into practice what has been heard (Oecumenius). Two things in particular are indicative of spiritual maturity: the ability to hold one’s tongue and a willingness to be generous toward those who are in need. A charitable disposition and charitable behavior must go hand in hand in the life of someone who wants to imitate God’s perfect charity. Widows and orphans are especially to be looked after (Hermas, Hilary of Arles). We become more like God in showing acts of mercy (Chrysostom). Illusions about one’s own correctness arise out of the lack of self-control (Gregory the Great, Oecumenius). Imitate God’s justice, which is without anger (Bede). Avoid uncontrollable fury, which leads to a habituation to wickedness (Andreas, Bede, Oecumenius). One single uniting Word is addressed to us through many scriptures (Augustine). We are called to enact in behavior what we hear (Augustine, Oecumenius). We best view our deeper selves in the mirror of the gospel (Hilary of Arles). Yet if we behold ourselves in this mirror and then forget it or fail to confirm it in deeds, what we have learned will slip out of our hands (Andreas, Oecumenius). The doer of the Word delights in the perfect law that liberates from sin and death (Augustine, Oecumenius).</run></section><section><run bold="true">1:16</run></section><section><run bold="true">Do Not Be Deceived</run></section><section><run bold="true">The Deception.

But as there are some people who argue from this that only the good things in life come from God, and not things which are regarded as bad or harmful, we have to recall such passages as “he brought evil on them,”3 “Evil came down from God onto the gates of Jerusalem”4 and so on.

It is clear that for James some of the most intractable problems on this score were influenced by economic factors. Rich people in the church were expecting and receiving special considerations from their wealth. This was an insidious attack on the gospel, which especially honored one who was poor in worldly goods but rich in spiritual things. To show contempt for the poor is as much an infraction of the law as murder or adultery, and it is even more serious because it is so common. Christians must learn to fight against the temptations of worldly wealth and concentrate instead on the heavenly blessings, which are the only true riches. Both rich and poor are all of one body in Christ (Chrysostom). Ostentation and favoritism are reproached (Augustine, Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius). God chooses the weak to shame the strong (Augustine). The nobility are not immune from criticism (Salvian). The displaced poor are comforted by God (Hilary of Arles), and their energies are especially used of God (Oecumenius). Those who base their lives on greed are the poorest of all (Chrysostom). Loving the neighbor has a literal reference to those immediately present, a spiritual reference to those absent, and a contemplative reference to love itself (Hilary of Arles). Treat the neighbor as you would one most dear (Andreas). To have fallen from the precept of love is thereby to have offended in all the other commandments (Caesarius of Arles, Augustine, Andreas). God’s righteousness is like a covering over the whole body, hiding all offenses (Gregory the Great). Adultery and murder are mentioned as extreme examples of offenses against love (Hilary of Arles, Oecumenius). There can be no favoritism in the law of liberty under which we are to be prepared to be judged (Oecumenius). Mercy breaks chains, dispels darkness, extinguishes fire, kills the worm and takes away the gnashing of teeth (Chrysostom). It is an oil of escape from the demonic (Hesychius). The mercy that one does not show to others will not be shown to him (Augustine, Braulio of Saragossa). We ask God to forgive us as we forgive others, but if we do not forgive, we shall not be forgiven (Oecumenius).</run></section><section><run bold="true">2:1</run></section><section><run bold="true">Impartiality</run></section><section><run bold="true">All of One Body.

But we have to understand that one leads to another. The corporal inspires us to go on to the spiritual, and that in turn lifts us up to the contemplative. The spiritual may sometimes regress to the merely corporal, but the contemplative never fails us. The corporal and spiritual forms of love are common to human beings and have analogies in animals, but the contemplative is reserved for humans alone.

Commentary on James.39 2:14–26 FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD</run></section><section><run bold="true">Overview: The duty to help one’s brothers and sisters in need is a paramount obligation of everyone who claims to have faith. Pious talk without equally serious deeds is not only useless but also wicked. Faith is shown through one’s deeds (Andreas). Those who practice evil but think they have faith are confused (Augustine). Words alone do not help the hungry (Bede). Love cares about the body as well as the soul (Hilary of Arles, Valerian of Cimiez). Opportunities to care for the poor may pass quickly (Caesarius of Arles). Clemency will be exalted above condemnation for those who are merciful (Leo). Lacking works, faith is dead (Origen, Augustine, Leo). Works give life to faith (Hilary of Arles). They have faith who are willing to follow Christ in his suffering (Symeon). Words alone do not save (Chrysostom). Faith shows through deeds (Symeon). The devils in a sense believe that God exists (Bede) with trembling and wordy confessions that Christ is Son of God (Andreas, Caesarius) but not with active love (Augustine). Worse than the devils are those who presume to have faith but do not even tremble (Hilary of Arles). No one receives the gift of justification on the basis of merit derived from works performed beforehand (Bede). Active faith shines forth through works (Cyril of Alexandria, Salvian). It is foolish to presume to believe without acting (Oecumenius).The Fathers were well aware that Paul had spoken of salvation by faith without the works of the law, but they saw no contradiction between that and what James is saying here. The reason for this is that James and Paul are speaking in complementary ways. It is impossible to earn salvation by doing things to please God, and everyone must be clear that we can be saved only by faith. Both belief and action are intrinsic to faith (Augustine, Bede, Oecumenius). Both Paul and James knew that Abraham was perfect in his faith as well as in his works (Bede). James is talking here about faith after baptism, for a faith without works can only make us more guilty of sin, seeing that we have received a talent but are not using it profitably (Oecumenius). Prebaptismal faith does not of itself require works but only confession and the word of salvation, by which those who believe in Christ are justified. Postbaptismal faith is conjoined with works (Andreas). Isaac was an earthly type of Christ being offered up for us all (Hilary of Arles). When Abraham bound Isaac to the altar, he did not merely do it as a work that was required of him, but with the faith that in Isaac his seed would be as numberless as the stars of heaven, believing that God could raise him from the dead (Cyril of Alexandria, Oecumenius). It was by Abraham’s perfect accomplishment of God’s command that the active faith that he had in his heart was shown to be perfect (Bede). His deeds were perfected by his faith (Cyril of Jerusalem). Although orthodox belief is the foundation of our common confession as Christians, it is not good enough merely to mouth the words of a creed or pronounce blessings. Christians must back up what they say with what they do. Otherwise their words will be disregarded and condemned for the hypocrites that they so obviously are.Abraham gives us a good example, since his faith led him to be willing to sacrifice his son Isaac. Rahab is even more remarkable. As a Gentile and a harlot, she did not have either the right theology or a respectable lifestyle, but God spared her because when the test came, she did the right thing. Rahab was justified by her faith because she performed works of mercy and showed hospitality to God’s people (Bede). Faith saves and then lives by doing its own works (Didymus). Christians must therefore be both inspired and warned by these examples; inspired, because we possess so much more knowledge of the truth than either Abraham or Rahab possessed and can therefore do so much more than they did, but also warned, because if we fail to do even as much as they did, we shall be punished all the more severely for having rejected the knowledge that we have been given (Bede).</run></section><section><run bold="true">2:14</run></section><section><run bold="true">Faith Without Works</run></section><section><run bold="true">Persistent Evil.

This is why he uses the example of Abraham, whom Paul also used as an example of faith, to show that the patriarch also performed good works in the light of his faith. It is therefore wrong to interpret Paul in such a way as to suggest that it did not matter whether Abraham put his faith into practice or not.

What does the fire stand for if not the suffering of Christ? What does the sword signify, if not death? What does the wood indicate, if not the cross? And what is the importance of Abraham’s heavy heart, if it does not stand for the compassion of the Father and the angels as they beheld the death of Christ? Isaac was an earthly type of Christ and was offered up for us all. According to tradition this occurred on 25 March, the day on which the world was created, the day on which the last judgment will occur. The place where it happened was none other than the one which God would later choose for the site of his temple on Mount Zion, which is so called because Zion means “mirror of life,” for it was there that Abraham saw as in a mirror the life which was to be revealed in the New Testament. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.29</run></section><section><run bold="true">Abraham’s Believing and Doing. Bede: James makes deft use of the example of Abraham in order to provoke those Jews who imagined that they were worthy followers of their great ancestor. In order to show them that they did not come up to the mark in times of trial and to test their faith by specific examples, James takes Abraham as his model. For what greater trial could there be than to demand that a man sacrifice his beloved son and heir? How much more would Abraham have preferred to give all the food and clothing he possessed to the poor than to be forced to make this supreme sacrifice at God’s command? James is merely echoing what it says in Hebrews: “By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son, of whom it was said, ‘Through Isaac shall your descendants be named.’ ”30 Looking at one and the same sacrifice, James praised the magnificence of Abraham’s work, while Paul praised the constancy of his faith. But in reality the two men are saying exactly the same thing, because they both knew that Abraham was perfect in his faith as well as in his works, and each one merely emphasized that aspect of the incident which his own audience was most in need of hearing. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.31</run></section><section><run bold="true">Distinguishing Pre- and Postbaptismal Faith. Andreas: Now someone might object to this and say: “Did Paul not use Abraham as an example of someone who was justified by faith, without works? And here James is using the very same Abraham as an example of someone who was justified, not by faith alone, but also by works which confirm that faith.” How can we answer this? And how can Abraham be an example of faith without works, as well as of faith with works, at the same time? But the solution is ready to hand from the Scriptures. For the same Abraham is at different times an example of both kinds of faith. The first is prebaptismal faith, which does not require works but only confession and the word of salvation, by which those who believe in Christ are justified. The second is postbaptismal faith, which is combined with works. Understood in this way, the two apostles do not contradict one another, but one and the same Spirit is speaking through both of them.

Likewise, when he bound Isaac to the altar, he did not merely do the work which was required of him, but he did it with the faith that in Isaac his seed would be as numberless as the stars of heaven, believing that God could raise him from the dead.33 Catena.34</run></section><section><run bold="true">2:22</run></section><section><run bold="true">Faith Is Completed by Works</run></section><section><run bold="true">Nothing Comparable to God’s Love.

But how can some say that because the spirit which gives life to the body is more honorable than the body, therefore works are more honorable than faith? I have looked into this matter in some detail and shall try to explain my position on this. It is undoubtedly true that the spirit is nobler than the body, but this does not mean that works can be put before faith, because a person is saved by grace, not by works but by faith. There should be no doubt but that faith saves and then lives by doing its own works, so that the works which are added to salvation by faith are not those of the law but a different kind of thing altogether.

Commentary on James.543:1–12 CONTROLLING THE TONGUE</run></section><section><run bold="true">Overview: Nothing can destroy a fellowship more quickly than verbal abuse and gossip. The tongue is the most powerful weapon that we have, both for good and for evil. It is a matter for wonder that such a small part of the body can do such great things. It can preach the Word of God, win nations for Christ and glorify the name of our Creator. But it can also destroy character, divide churches and kill the soul. Human beings have learned to tame horses and ships, but their own tongues are another matter. Yet the tongue only reflects what is going on in the heart and soul of the person who is speaking, and it is this fact that is the real danger. For if a person claims to be a believer but then says things that contradict that claim, the truth is that he or she is not a Christian. No one is perfect, and we must be ready to make allowances for the failings of others rather than criticize them. Moreover, teachers will be judged by a higher standard, and therefore they must take special care not to fall into the trap of verbal abuse.Christ chose only twelve teachers, and some of them did not come through (Hilary of Arles). The deeds of teachers must correspond with their words (Chrysostom, Oecumenius). Some are too eager to teach, so as to lead to false teaching (Isho‘dad, Bede). James singles out the tongue as a special instrument for either great good or great evil (Didymus, Jerome, Bede). No one is free from sins of the tongue (Augustine, Oecumenius). Yet the saints seek to allay God’s judgment on their speech (Severus, Cyril of Alexandria) and pray for the healing of their speech (Pachomius). We may be imperfect, but we can still seek to avoid deception, cursing, pride, boasting, quarreling, lying and perjury (Bede). Sins of the tongue are many (Basil). So put brakes on the mouth (Augustine, Bede). The tongue is like a fire (Hilary of Arles) that can destroy a whole forest of good works just by saying evil things (Bede). The tongue can infect like gangrene (Pachomius, Oecumenius). The metaphor of the horse with bit in mouth (Chrysostom) is complemented by that of the ruddered ship (Andreas, Oecumenius): the great ship of life is blown by strong winds of passion yet directed by a small rudder—the intention of the heart (Bede). Taming the tongue is harder than taming a wild beast (Augustine, Andreas). Like a sword, the tongue is capable of wounding (Chrysostom, Hesychius). It is not made for cursing (Andreas). If mixed, the bitter water overcomes the sweet water (Bede). Yet the bad tongue can be converted, as in the case of Paul (Andreas).</run></section><section><run bold="true">3:1a</run></section><section><run bold="true">Let Not Many of You Become Teachers</run></section><section><run bold="true">Christ Chose Only Twelve.

Yet if there is no contradiction between what he says and what he does, and he is able to control his entire body, then do not condemn him.

Bede: In the days of the apostles there were many who were eager to go out preaching the Word of God but who lacked proper instruction.

But because he was a wise person, it was not long before a teacher appeared and led him into greater truth, which he readily accepted and thus became even better at his preaching task. There were others who were much less skilled who went to Antioch from Judea and told people there that they had to be circumcised according to the law of Moses if they wanted to be saved, a message which gave orthodox preachers no little trouble. It is this second kind of teacher that James wants to remove from office, so that they will not be a hindrance to those who are trying to preach the gospel in the right way. For just as someone who serves well obtains a good report, so someone who tries to usurp the right to teach when he is not prepared to do so deserves greater punishment than the one he would have received if he had kept his wickedness to himself.

This false wisdom is a lie that leads to every kind of evil practice, and Christians must do their utmost to avoid it. God’s wisdom has many important features, but it is most noticeable when it brings peace within and among believers. Bitterness and jealousy are demonically conceived (Cassiodorus) and taint everything they touch (Bede). As long as the soul seeks earthly glory, it is deprived of spiritual grace (Bede). As filth blinds, so does ambition (Chrysostom). Gracious wisdom, born of pure thoughts (Bede), comes from above, not from our power (Augustine). Having labored in this world, rejoice in the harvest of righteousness in the world to come (Origen).

Concerning the Epistle of St. James.124:1–10 EFFECTIVE PRAYER</run></section><section><run bold="true">Overview: There is nothing wrong with wanting to enjoy God’s creation, but everything depends on recognizing what those good things are and seeking them in the right way. Do not become fixated on making comparisons between what you own and what your neighbor owns (Dionysius of Alexandria). This intensifies the struggle within (Bede). When someone desires something inordinately, it tends to ensure the receiving of the opposite (Oecumenius). God will see to it that petitions arising from bad motives will not be fulfilled (Augustine, Andreas). So pray for right motives (Bede). The godly petitioner asks only for what is compatible with the divine promises (Didymus), for what pleases God and for what God will freely give (Pseudo-Dionysius). There can be no enduring coexistence of virtue with evil (Origen, Didymus), and so it has been since the fallen angels and Adam (Hilary of Arles). Our enmities tend to make us morally blind (Oecumenius, Symeon). So make the proper use of wisdom (Oecumenius).God yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us. This is so whether it refers to God’s Spirit or the spirit in us that draws us toward God (Severian, Bede). Beware of self-conceit (Jerome, Augustine). Draw near to gracious people (Clement of Rome). God wants to dwell in you (Caesarius of Arles), but this indwelling can occur only in a humble, merciful heart (Macarius of Egypt, Valerian). God resists the proud who trust in their own strength but gives grace to the humble because they recognize their need and ask him for help (Didymus, Hesychius, Bede, Oecumenius). God dwells in us (Ambrose) that he might destroy the death that has come upon us and give us more grace (Andreas).Meanwhile we must fight against demonic captivity (Caesarius of Arles), a struggle in which one cannot be double-minded (Oecumenius). Those who remain unashamed of their sin are miserable, not so much because they have fallen from grace but because they have remained in their fallen state (Chrysostom). Mourn your sins (Leander). Be ready to repent while there is time (Bede). The most important blessings that we can ever receive are spiritual ones, and Christians must be sufficiently detached from the cares of this world that they can recognize this and pray for that kind of blessing. There is no room here for compromise. To embrace the world is to reject God. By world James means the desires of ungodly people, who are at war with the Spirit of God. The only way to deal with this effectively is to humble ourselves and turn back to God in prayer and supplication. If we do this, we shall be full of contrition, and our prayers will be punctured by weeping rather than by laughter. Only if we come to God as abject penitents will he be willing to help us, but when we have that attitude, then we shall discover that far from rejecting us, he lifts us up and receives us with great joy and gladness into his heavenly kingdom.</run></section><section><run bold="true">4:1a</run></section><section><run bold="true">The Cause of Infighting</run></section><section><run bold="true">Excessive Comparison.

Murder and fighting are not good things, but neither do the good things which they desire follow from them. Note also that here James speaks of murder and of fighting as spiritual things, not physical ones. It would be bad enough to think this kind of thing about robbers, but how much worse it is when we are dealing with people who have a certain amount of faith and who have turned to God.

It is all too easy to map out a future in which God has no place, but we must remember that everything we do is bound by the limits of time and of his will. To forget this is to fall back into the sin of pride, which can only lead to our destruction. Many would prefer to mind the business of others more than their own (Cyril of Alexandria). Such pride ultimately arises from contempt of others (Oecumenius). Our knowing complicates our sinning (Augustine). The faith rightly proclaimed must first be lived (Oecumenius).

Although God now waits for our repentance (Cyril of Alexandria), he may come quickly at any time to dispense justice (Bede). As in the case of Job, the devil is allowed to put us on trial, not merely in order to take our possessions away but that when that happens he can force us to curse God because of it (Chrysostom).

This is what Job did when, in great suffering, he thanked God, saying: “The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away.”6 Let no one say that he was not grieving over what had happened to him or that he did not feel it deeply. Do not take away the great praise due to the righteous.… How great is this praise? Tell me, in what circumstances do you bless Job? Is it when he had all those camels and flocks and herds? Or is it when he says: “The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away”? For the devil also harms us not in order to take our possessions away so that we have nothing left but so that when that happens he can force us to curse God because of it.

Augustine: James means: “Bear your temporal misfortunes as Job did, but do not hope for temporal goods as a reward for your patience, such as were returned to him double.

Bede: God shows his compassion toward us by setting us free from our temptations in this life and by glorifying the living before others because of the constancy of their faith. After their deaths he crowns them in secret, so that the memory which they deserve will not be taken away from them by other people. Concerning the Epistle of St. James.95:12–20 SPIRITUAL GUIDANCE</run></section><section><run bold="true">Overview: James closes his letter with a brief sketch of how we should conduct our relationship with God. First of all, it is important to avoid demeaning God’s name, which points to his power and presence in the world. Let the witness of your life be stronger than any oath (Cyril of Alexandria). An oath adds nothing to a simple yes or no (Chrysostom) and tends toward disaster as seen in the case of Herod (Bede). We must not give the creation more value than it has by deifying it (Cyril of Alexandria). The need of an oath comes from an unsure conscience (Leander). Pray and praise God whether in good times or bad (Andreas, Bede).In time of suffering and illness we must turn to God, and if our sins are too great for us to deal with on our own, we must call the elders of the church to come and assist us. The apostolic tradition calls for the elders to anoint the sick with the oil of mercy and pray for their healing (Hilary of Arles, Bede, Oecumenius). The prayer of faith is efficacious (Caesarius of Arles) when it gives expression to the petition of the whole consenting church (Hilary of Arles). Do not leave sin unconfessed and ignored either in your own house or another’s (Augustine). And do not bore others with every detail (Braulio of Saragossa). The Lord himself who had no sin sets the example for sinners to pray for our sins (Augustine). Prayers of the righteous are beneficial (Pseudo-Dionysius), especially when one does works fitting to the prayer (Maximus the Confessor). God loves to be asked (Bede). The effectiveness of prayer offered by the right people in the right way can never be underestimated, as the case of Elijah reminds us. We are called to persevere in prayer like Elijah (Hilary of Arles), who was on fire with zeal for God (Chrysostom, Theodoret).The most important thing of all is to recover the lost sheep who have gone astray, and those who do this will give incontrovertible proof of the fact that they are ready to reign with Christ in his eternal kingdom. One who converts others will save his own soul (Origen, Hilary of Arles). Out of love (Bede) the shepherd of souls rescues and delivers souls from death (Gregory the Great, Symeon). Unless we protect what has been sown in us by constant care, the devil will snatch it away (Chrysostom).</run></section><section><run bold="true">5:12a</run></section><section><run bold="true">Do Not Swear</run></section><section><run bold="true">An Oath Adds Nothing. Chrysostom: What if someone swears an oath and claims that he was forced to do so? The fear of God is more powerful than any force. For though you may start out by swearing all kinds of promises, you will not keep any of them. Moreover, you would not dare to swear or give an oath in matters of human law, which you accept whether you want to or not. You would certainly never claim that you were forced into doing so. Now the person who has heard the blessings of God and who has prepared himself as Christ has commanded will never claim any need to do anything of the kind, for he is respected and honored by all. What is needed beyond a simple yes and no? An oath adds nothing to these, for no one has to be told that evil is the source of both excess and its deficient opposite. An oath is a form of excess. Catena.1</run></section><section><run bold="true">Do Not Deify Creation. Cyril of Alexandria: Let the witness of our life be stronger than an oath, and if some shameless person dares to ask an oath from you, let your yes be yes and your no be no, instead of swearing an oath. James forbids us to swear by heaven or by earth for this reason, that we should not give the creation more value than it has by deifying it. For those who swear, swear by something greater than themselves, as the apostle says.2 Catena.3</run></section><section><run bold="true">Herod’s Oath Recalled. Bede: This is the judgment to which Herod fell victim, so that he found that he had either to break his oath or commit another shameful act in order to avoid breaking it.

Leander: Jesus said: “Let your yes be yes and your no, no.” Any more than this is evil. So do not swear for good reason, because that is evil. It is said to be evil because the need of an oath comes from an unsure conscience. It is necessary to extract an oath from one whose sincerity is in doubt, but why should you bind yourself by an involuntary oath when you are bound to show with your lips the sincerity of your heart? Speak the truth from your heart and you will not need an oath.

Bede: Just as James forbade people to complain to each other about their sufferings, so now he goes on to say how they should behave. If someone has suffered an injury, he ought to go to the church and pray that God will send him the grace of his comfort, so that the sadness of this world, which leads to death, will not overtake him.

Hilary of Arles: This sickness is the sickness of sin. If someone is struck down by his own thoughts, then he should pray on his own, but if he has committed some sin he should ask for the church’s prayers. The custom mentioned here is followed even today, for the grace of mercy is symbolized by oil. Introductory Tractate on the Letter of James.8</run></section><section><run bold="true">Pray for the Sick. Bede: Just as he has already advised the person who has been injured, so now James gives his advice to the one who is ill. In order to prevent the foolishness of complaining, he told the injured person to pray and sing, and now he tells the person who is sick, either in body or in faith, to call the elders in proportion to the gravity of the illness which he is enduring. James does not advise this person to call the younger members of the church because they are less experienced in such matters and run the risk of saying or doing something which will make matters worse. We read in the New Testament that the apostles did this sort of thing, and the custom is retained in the church, that the priests will anoint a person who is ill and pray for his healing. And this is not the prerogative of the priests only, for in cases of necessity any Christian may do this, provided that he uses only oil which has been consecrated by the bishop. And of course anyone who anoints a sick person in this way must invoke the name of God over him while doing so.

Bede: We must use our common sense in applying this commandment. As far as small, everyday sins are concerned, we ought to admit them to one another and believe that we are saved from them by praying for each other.

Braulio of Saragossa: Since it would be a long and unpleasant task to reveal my sinful ways to you and to tell you everything in detail, it must suffice for me to reveal to your most holy mind that I am not what you believe, though I beg you to pray to God that he might make me what you believe.

Maximus the Confessor: There are two ways in which the prayer of a righteous man is effective. The first is when the person praying does so by offering to God his works done according to his commands. Then the prayer is not just a matter of words, blurted out meaninglessly with the empty echo of the tongue, but powerful and living and inspired with the spirit of the commandments. For the true basis of prayer and supplication is the fulfillment of the commandments by virtue. This makes the prayer of a righteous person strong and full of power. The second way is when the person who asks for the prayers of a righteous man fulfills the works of prayer, above all by putting his life right. Then he makes the prayer of the righteous man strong, because it is reinforced by his own wonderful conversion. For there is nothing to be profited by a person who makes use of the prayer of a righteous man if he is himself already more inclined to virtue than to vice.

Chrysostom: And how do you go about converting someone? It is like the seeds sown by farmers. They are sown once, but they do not survive forever unless they are carefully nurtured. And unless the tillers of the soil protect the seeds, they will be exposed to the birds and to every seed-eating creature. We are just like this, unless we protect what has been sown in us by constant care, for the devil will snatch it away and our own lethargy will destroy it. The sun dries it up, the rain drowns it, and weeds choke it, so that it is not enough for the sower to pass by once only. Rather he must tend it often, driving away the birds of the air, pulling up the weeds and filling up the rocky places with much soil. He must prevent, block off and eject any form of destruction. Where soil is concerned, everything depends on the farmer, for without him it remains lifeless, ready only to suffer harm. It is not like that with spiritual soil however. For in spiritual matters it is not all up to the teachers; at least half the effort must come from the pupils. It is up to us the teachers to sow the seed but up to you the pupils to do the rest.
